  In this project, the user will be able to run the Employee Summary application through the node terminal. This application will create an HTML page that will display a small summary of their employees. Once you clone the repository, open your terminal through through the cloned file and check out [installation](#installation). Afterwards, you'll be able to run the command ``` node app.js ```. The user will then be prompted through a list of team members they can add. Once they have added all their team members added, they can execute the "I'm finished" command. This will then generate the user's page.
